<h2>Hello visitor!</h2>

    Here you can see all the projects I've been working on.

 
 


I am a passionate learner, I believe that continuous training and practice are essential to evolve as a developer.

My first scripts started at Henry's Fullstack web development camp.

Observer of the change that is taking place in our finance system, of which I hope soon, to be able to be part of the development side.

In constant change. Faithful believer that the best solutions are built with teamwork.

I prioritize teamwork and respect among the people I work with.

In life one has only teachers.

<h2>Henry Diamonds 
<p width='40%' height="100%"align="rigth"> 
    <h3>Final work done in SoyHenry. Along with 6 great companions</h3>
    Our group decided to use the theme of precious stones and the objects that can be made with them. Here we managed to strengthen our knowledge of the language learned during the bootcamp. Such as "JavaScript, React, Redux and material UI " for the front side, AND "Node.js, JavaScript, Sequelize, Postgress" for the Backend side.
    <p>I had the opportunity to get to know both worlds of programming, playing both a communicative role and acting as a link between the needs of the Front team and the Back team. From my role as a developer, my field of action was mainly front-end development. With more direct participation in the elaboration of the shopping cart, its corresponding payment methods and the selection and saving of the user's favs</p><p> 
    <p>We generated our own Database, relations and route creation for the front and their documentation. By clicking on the link below you can access the project page. Thanks so much for reading!!!</p>
